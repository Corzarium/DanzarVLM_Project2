# Vision Commentary TTS Fix Summary

## üéØ **Problem Identified**

Your vision integration system was working correctly - detecting events and generating commentary - but the **TTS (Text-to-Speech) for vision commentary was not playing through Discord**. The text commentary was being sent to Discord successfully, but the audio was not playing.

## ‚úÖ **Root Cause Analysis**

The issue was in the **TTS callback mechanism**:

1. **‚úÖ Conversational TTS**: Working perfectly - when you talk to Danzar, you hear responses
2. **‚ùå Vision Commentary TTS**: Not working - using default callbacks that only logged to console

### The Problem:
- The `!watch` command sets up proper TTS callbacks that use the TTS service and play audio through Discord
- The **auto-start feature** in vision integration was using **default callbacks** that only logged to console
- Vision commentary TTS was being generated but not played through Discord

## üîß **The Fix Applied**

### 1. **Updated Default TTS Callback**
Modified the auto-start TTS callback in `services/vision_integration_service.py`:

**Before:**
```python
async def default_tts_callback(text: str):
    """Default TTS callback that logs to console."""
    if self.logger:
        self.logger.info(f"[VisionIntegration] üîä TTS: {text[:200]}...")
```

**After:**
```python
async def default_tts_callback(text: str):
    """Default TTS callback that uses TTS service and plays through Discord."""
    try:
        if self.logger:
            self.logger.info(f"[VisionIntegration] üîä TTS: {text[:200]}...")
        
        # Use TTS service if available
        if hasattr(self.app_context, 'tts_service') and self.app_context.tts_service:
            tts_audio = await self.app_context.tts_service.synthesize_speech(text)
            if tts_audio:
                # Play through Discord if bot is available
                bot = getattr(self.app_context, 'bot', None)
                if bot and hasattr(bot, '_play_tts_audio_with_feedback_prevention'):
                    await bot._play_tts_audio_with_feedback_prevention(tts_audio)
                    if self.logger:
                        self.logger.info("[VisionIntegration] TTS audio played through Discord successfully")
```

### 2. **Updated Fallback TTS Callback**
Also updated the fallback TTS callback to use the same approach for consistency.

## üéâ **Expected Results**

After this fix, you should see:

1. **‚úÖ Vision events detected** (OCR, YOLO, CLIP)
2. **‚úÖ Commentary generated** by the VLM
3. **‚úÖ Text sent to Discord** channel
4. **‚úÖ TTS audio played through Discord** voice channel

### Log Messages to Look For:
```
[VisionIntegration] üîä TTS: It looks like you're watching a game where...
[VisionIntegration] TTS audio played through Discord successfully
```

## üöÄ **How to Test**

1. **Restart your DanzarVLM application**
2. **Wait for vision events to be detected** (OCR, YOLO)
3. **Check Discord text channel** for commentary messages
4. **Listen for TTS audio** in Discord voice channel

### Test Commands:
- `!status` - Check if vision integration is running
- `!watch` - Manually start vision commentary (if needed)
- `!stopwatch` - Stop vision commentary

## üìã **Technical Details**

### TTS Pipeline Flow:
1. **Vision Event Detected** ‚Üí OCR/YOLO/CLIP
2. **Commentary Generated** ‚Üí VLM processes vision data
3. **Text Callback** ‚Üí Sends text to Discord channel
4. **TTS Callback** ‚Üí Generates audio and plays through Discord

### Key Components:
- **TTS Service**: `app_context.tts_service` - Generates audio from text
- **Discord Bot**: `app_context.bot` - Plays audio through voice channel
- **Audio Playback**: `_play_tts_audio_with_feedback_prevention()` - Handles Discord audio

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

If TTS still doesn't work:

1. **Check TTS Service**: `!tts status`
2. **Check Voice Connection**: `!status`
3. **Check Vision Integration**: Look for "TTS audio played through Discord successfully" in logs
4. **Manual Test**: Use `!watch` command to test with manual callbacks

## üìù **Summary**

The fix ensures that **vision commentary TTS uses the same audio pipeline as conversational TTS**, playing through Discord voice channels instead of just logging to console. This provides a complete vision commentary experience with both text and audio feedback.
