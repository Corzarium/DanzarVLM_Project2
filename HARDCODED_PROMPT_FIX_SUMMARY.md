# Hardcoded Prompt Fix Summary

## âœ… COMPLETED: All Hardcoded Prompts Replaced

### Files Fixed:
1. **services/memory_manager.py** (Line 311)
2. **services/llm_service.py** (Line 1737) 
3. **services/vision_aware_conversation_service.py** (Line 581)
4. **services/multi_llm_coordinator.py** (Line 444)

### Changes Made:
All hardcoded "You are Danzar" prompts have been replaced with:

```python
system_prompt = self.app_context.active_profile.system_prompt_commentary if self.app_context and hasattr(self.app_context, 'active_profile') else "You are DANZAR, a vision-capable gaming assistant with a witty personality."
```

### What This Means:
- âœ… **Primary**: Uses the detailed DANZAR personality from `config/profiles/generic.yaml`
- âœ… **Fallback**: Uses a consistent DANZAR personality if profile is unavailable
- âœ… **Consistent**: All services now use the same personality system
- âœ… **Vision-Aware**: The profile includes vision capabilities and tool awareness

### Profile Content:
The `generic.yaml` profile contains:
- Detailed DANZAR personality with vision capabilities
- Tool awareness and gaming expertise
- Consistent tone and behavior across all services

### Next Steps:
1. **Restart Danzar** to see the personality changes
2. **Test vision capabilities** to ensure they work with the new prompts
3. **Verify tool awareness** in responses

### Expected Results:
- Danzar should now consistently identify as DANZAR
- Vision capabilities should be properly referenced
- Tool awareness should be maintained
- Personality should be consistent across all interactions
