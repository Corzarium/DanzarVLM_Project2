# Commentary Generation Fixes Summary

## üîç **Issues Identified and Fixed**

### **Issue 1: Event Loop Problems**
**Problem**: The `_process_commentary_trigger` method was trying to create async tasks but failing due to event loop issues.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Replaced complex async task creation with a simple queue-based approach
- Added `pending_commentary_prompts` list to store prompts for later processing
- Updated `_process_commentary_trigger` to store prompts instead of creating async tasks

### **Issue 2: Event Processing Flow**
**Problem**: Events were being stored but not processed correctly in the event loop.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated event processor loop to process `pending_commentary_prompts` first
- Added proper logging for prompt processing
- Ensured events flow: `_handle_vision_event` ‚Üí `pending_events` ‚Üí `_process_commentary_trigger` ‚Üí `pending_commentary_prompts` ‚Üí `_generate_commentary`

### **Issue 3: CLIP Event Loop Errors**
**Problem**: CLIP updates were trying to create async tasks without a running event loop.

**Fix Applied**:
- CLIP updates are now stored in `pending_clip_updates` for later processing
- Event processor loop handles CLIP updates asynchronously
- Removed direct async task creation from CLIP handling

## üîß **Code Changes Made**

### **1. Added Missing Attributes**
```python
# In __init__ method
self.pending_commentary_prompts = []
```

### **2. Simplified Commentary Trigger Processing**
```python
def _process_commentary_trigger(self, trigger_event: DetectionEvent):
    """Process a commentary trigger with unified prompt."""
    try:
        self.last_commentary_time = time.time()
        self.pending_commentary = True
        self.current_commentary_topic = f"{trigger_event.object_type}: {trigger_event.label}"
        analysis = self._analyze_recent_detections()
        prompt = self._create_unified_prompt(trigger_event, analysis)
        
        # Store the prompt for processing in the event loop
        self.pending_commentary_prompts.append(prompt)
        
        if self.logger:
            self.logger.info(f"[VisionIntegration] Stored commentary prompt for processing")
            
    except Exception as e:
        if self.logger:
            self.logger.error(f"[VisionIntegration] Commentary processing error: {e}")
```

### **3. Enhanced Event Processor Loop**
```python
async def _event_processor_loop(self):
    """Main event processing loop for commentary generation."""
    try:
        while self.is_watching and not self.app_context.shutdown_event.is_set():
            try:
                # Process pending commentary prompts FIRST
                if hasattr(self, 'pending_commentary_prompts') and self.pending_commentary_prompts:
                    pending_prompts = self.pending_commentary_prompts.copy()
                    self.pending_commentary_prompts.clear()
                    
                    if self.logger:
                        self.logger.info(f"[VisionIntegration] Processing {len(pending_prompts)} pending commentary prompts")
                    
                    for prompt in pending_prompts:
                        await self._generate_commentary(prompt)
                
                # Then process pending events
                if hasattr(self, 'pending_events') and self.pending_events:
                    # ... process events ...
                
                # Then process CLIP updates
                if self.pending_clip_updates:
                    # ... process CLIP updates ...
                    
            except Exception as e:
                if self.logger:
                    self.logger.error(f"[VisionIntegration] Event processor error: {e}")
                await asyncio.sleep(1.0)
    except Exception as e:
        if self.logger:
            self.logger.error(f"[VisionIntegration] Event processor loop error: {e}")
```

## üìä **Expected Results**

After applying these fixes, you should see in the logs:

1. **Event Detection**: `[VisionIntegration] Commentary trigger detected: yolo: health_bar`
2. **Event Processing**: `[VisionIntegration] Processing 1 pending events`
3. **Prompt Processing**: `[VisionIntegration] Processing 1 pending commentary prompts`
4. **Commentary Generation**: `[VisionIntegration] Generating commentary with prompt length: ...`
5. **Model Response**: `[VisionIntegration] Model client response: ...`
6. **TTS Callback**: `[VisionIntegration] Calling TTS callback with: ...`
7. **Final Result**: `[VisionIntegration] Commentary generated: ...`

## üéØ **Key Improvements**

1. **Reliable Event Processing**: Events are now processed in a predictable order
2. **Better Error Handling**: Async task creation errors are eliminated
3. **Improved Logging**: More detailed logging for debugging
4. **Queue-Based Architecture**: Simpler, more reliable event processing
5. **Full Image Context**: Screenshots are still sent to VLM for complete context

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. **Restart the application** to apply the fixes
2. **Test with `!watch` command** to verify commentary generation
3. **Monitor logs** for the new debug messages
4. **Verify VLM connection** is working correctly

The commentary system should now work reliably with proper event processing and full visual context integration.
