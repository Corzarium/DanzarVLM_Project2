üöÄ Project Goal
DanzarVLM is a modular Python-based AI assistant that can:

üîç Watch gameplay via NDI stream frame capture

üß† Analyze screenshots with a Visual Language Model (VLM)

üìö Retrieve context using a Qdrant-powered RAG system

üí¨ Respond through Discord or TTS

üó£Ô∏è Activate via wake-word or chat triggers

Use cases include live game commentary, in-game coaching, alerts, and lore referencing.

üìÅ Folder Breakdown
Folder	Description
audio_integration/	Wake word listener and microphone input (used for real-time voice triggers).
chroma_rag_db/	Legacy or placeholder RAG code (being phased out in favor of Qdrant).
config/	YAML configuration files to control model behavior, services, and system settings.
discord_integration/	Discord bot logic, command handlers, and async message flows.
ndi_integration/	Captures frames from NDI video streams (OBS/Game client output).
services/	Core logic hub: LLM client, image parser, context dispatcher, and model routing.
tts_integration/	Routes generated responses to Chatterbox TTS server or alternatives.
utils/	Helper scripts used across services for logging, image conversion, or device checks.

üìã Features & TODOs
‚úÖ Done
Voice-triggered activation

Discord bot text interaction

NDI screenshot pipeline

LLM + TTS integration

Chatterbox web server (running on port 8055)

üõ†Ô∏è In Progress
Supabase RAG (optional alternative to Qdrant)

Expanded screenshot labeling and interpretation

Auto-alert system for low health/mana

In-game object tracking from screenshots

ü§ñ Tips for Devs & LLMs
To change behavior or profile, edit config/global_settings.yaml.

Main entry point logic lives in DanzarVLM.py and services/.

Frame analysis begins in ndi_integration/frame_capture.py.

TTS output goes through tts_integration/tts_router.py.

RAG queries are handled via services/context_memory.py (Qdrant-backed).

Discord command routing is in discord_integration/bot_client.py
