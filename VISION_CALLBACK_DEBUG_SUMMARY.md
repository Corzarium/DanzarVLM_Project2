# Vision Callback Debug Summary

## Issue Analysis

Based on the logs and code analysis, the vision integration service is generating commentary and TTS is working, but **text callbacks are never being called**. The issue appears to be that the callbacks become invalid after the `!watch` command completes.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Logging in `_generate_commentary` Method

The `_generate_commentary` method now has extensive logging to track:
- When text callbacks are called
- Whether callbacks are available and callable
- Fallback Discord message attempts
- TTS callback status
- Voice connection status

### 2. Test Callbacks in `start_watching` Method

The `start_watching` method now includes immediate callback testing:
- Tests text callback immediately after being set
- Tests TTS callback immediately after being set
- Logs success/failure of callback tests

### 3. Enhanced Event Processor Loop Logging

The event processor loop now logs:
- When commentary prompts are being processed
- Number of pending prompts
- When `_generate_commentary` is called
- Debug info when no prompts are found

### 4. Enhanced `_process_commentary_trigger` Logging

The trigger processing method now logs:
- When prompts are stored for processing
- Total number of pending prompts
- Prompt length information

## What to Look For in Logs

### When Starting `!watch`:

Look for these log entries:
```
[VisionIntegration] Testing callbacks immediately...
[VisionIntegration] Testing text callback...
[VisionIntegration] ✅ Text callback test successful
[VisionIntegration] Testing TTS callback...
[VisionIntegration] ✅ TTS callback test successful
```

### When Commentary is Generated:

Look for these log entries:
```
[VisionIntegration] >>> ABOUT TO CALL TEXT CALLBACK with: '...'
[VisionIntegration] >>> TEXT CALLBACK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
```

OR if callbacks fail:
```
[VisionIntegration] >>> NO TEXT CALLBACK AVAILABLE
[VisionIntegration] >>> TEXT CALLBACK FAILED OR NOT AVAILABLE, TRYING FALLBACK
[VisionIntegration] >>> SENDING FALLBACK DISCORD MESSAGE to ...
[VisionIntegration] >>> FALLBACK DISCORD MESSAGE SENT SUCCESSFULLY
```

### When Events are Processed:

Look for these log entries:
```
[VisionIntegration] Processing X pending commentary prompts
[VisionIntegration] Generating commentary for prompt 1/X: ...
[VisionIntegration] Stored commentary prompt for processing (total prompts: X)
```

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Restart the Application

After the changes, restart the application to ensure the new logging is active.

### 2. Run `!watch` Command

Use the `!watch` command and monitor the logs for:
- Callback test results during startup
- Commentary generation attempts
- Text callback calls or failures

### 3. Check for Specific Log Patterns

**If text callbacks work:**
- You should see "✅ Text callback test successful" during startup
- You should see ">>> TEXT CALLBACK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY" during commentary

**If text callbacks fail:**
- You should see "❌ Text callback test failed" during startup
- You should see fallback Discord message attempts
- You should see ">>> FALLBACK DISCORD MESSAGE SENT SUCCESSFULLY"

**If no commentary is generated:**
- Check if "Processing X pending commentary prompts" appears
- Check if "Generating commentary for prompt" appears
- Check if "Stored commentary prompt for processing" appears

## Expected Behavior

With these changes, you should see:

1. **During `!watch` startup:**
   - Callback tests run immediately
   - Success/failure logged clearly

2. **During commentary generation:**
   - Text callbacks called with detailed logging
   - Fallback mechanisms if callbacks fail
   - Clear success/failure indicators

3. **In Discord:**
   - Either text messages from callbacks OR fallback messages
   - TTS audio playback (which was already working)

## Troubleshooting

### If Callback Tests Fail During Startup:
- The callbacks are becoming invalid immediately
- Check the `!watch` command implementation in `DanzarVLM.py`

### If Commentary Generation Fails:
- Check if prompts are being stored: "Stored commentary prompt for processing"
- Check if prompts are being processed: "Processing X pending commentary prompts"
- Check if `_generate_commentary` is being called: "Generating commentary for prompt"

### If Text Callbacks Fail During Commentary:
- Check for fallback Discord message attempts
- Verify the bot has access to the configured text channel
- Check for any exception details in the logs

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the application** with these changes
2. **Run `!watch`** and monitor the logs carefully
3. **Look for the specific log patterns** mentioned above
4. **Report back** what you see in the logs, especially:
   - Do callback tests pass during startup?
   - Are text callbacks called during commentary?
   - Do fallback Discord messages work?
   - What specific error messages appear?

This extensive logging will help us pinpoint exactly where the disconnect is occurring between vision integration and Discord communication.
