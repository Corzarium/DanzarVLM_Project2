# Agentic Vision Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented **agentic vision control** for DanzarAI, transforming the system from periodic automatic scanning to on-demand screenshot capture controlled by the LLM through LangChain tools.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated LangChain Agent System Prompt

**File**: `services/langchain_tools_service.py`

**Changes**:
- Enhanced system prompt to explicitly inform the LLM about its screenshot capabilities
- Added clear instructions that the LLM controls when to use vision tools
- Emphasized that no automatic scanning is happening - screenshots only when tools request them
- Updated tool descriptions to be more explicit about when and how to use screenshot tools

**Key System Prompt Updates**:
```python
ðŸŽ® **Vision Tools**: 
- You can take a screenshot of the game at any time using your tools
- Use the screenshot and vision tools whenever you need to see the game or answer questions about the current screen
- You have full control over when to capture and analyze screenshots - only do so when you need to see what's happening

**Agentic Behavior Guidelines:**
- You control when to use vision tools - there's no automatic scanning happening
- If someone asks about what's on screen, what's happening in the game, or what you can see, use your screenshot tools
- Take screenshots proactively when you need visual context to answer questions
```

### 2. Disabled Periodic Vision Scanning

**File**: `vision_pipeline.py`

**Changes**:
- Modified `start()` method to disable automatic capture loop
- Added `agentic_mode = True` flag
- Removed automatic frame capture thread
- Added `capture_frame_on_demand()` method for tool-initiated captures
- Updated logging to indicate agentic mode is active

**Key Changes**:
```python
# AGENTIC MODE: Disable automatic capture loop - only capture when tools request it
self.agentic_mode = True
self.logger.info("ðŸŽ¯ AGENTIC MODE ENABLED: Automatic frame capture disabled - screenshots only when tools request them")

# Start processing thread only (no capture loop)
self.processing_thread = threading.Thread(target=self._processing_loop, daemon=True)
self.processing_thread.start()
```

### 3. Enhanced Screenshot Capture Method

**File**: `services/vision_integration_service.py`

**Changes**:
- Updated `_capture_current_screenshot()` to use on-demand capture
- Prioritizes vision pipeline's `capture_frame_on_demand()` method
- Falls back to NDI service if vision pipeline unavailable
- Final fallback to PIL screen capture
- Improved logging for agentic mode

**Key Changes**:
```python
# Use vision pipeline's on-demand capture if available
if hasattr(self, 'vision_pipeline') and self.vision_pipeline:
    frame = self.vision_pipeline.capture_frame_on_demand()
    if frame is not None:
        # Convert frame to base64
        success, buffer = cv2.imencode('.jpg', frame, [cv2.IMWRITE_JPEG_QUALITY, 95])
        if success:
            image_base64 = base64.b64encode(buffer.tobytes()).decode('utf-8')
            return image_base64
```

### 4. Updated Tool Descriptions

**File**: `services/langchain_tools_service.py`

**Changes**:
- Enhanced vision tool descriptions to be more explicit about capabilities
- Added clear instructions about when to use each tool
- Emphasized agentic control over screenshot timing

**Updated Tool Descriptions**:
```python
self._create_vision_tool("capture_screenshot", "Capture a screenshot of the current game screen from OBS NDI stream. Use this whenever you need to see what's happening in the game or when someone asks about the current screen."),
self._create_vision_tool("analyze_screenshot", "Analyze a screenshot to understand what's happening in the game. Use this after capturing a screenshot to get detailed information about objects, text, UI elements, and game state."),
```

## Benefits of Agentic Vision Control

### 1. **Performance Optimization**
- No continuous frame processing consuming resources
- Screenshots only captured when needed
- Reduced GPU/CPU usage during idle periods

### 2. **Intelligent Context Awareness**
- LLM decides when visual context is needed
- Screenshots captured with specific intent
- Better integration with conversation flow

### 3. **Reduced Noise**
- No automatic commentary on every frame
- Vision analysis only when relevant
- Cleaner conversation experience

### 4. **User Control**
- Users can ask for screenshots when needed
- Natural conversation flow with visual context
- Explicit control over when vision is used

## How It Works

### 1. **User Interaction Flow**
```
User: "What can you see on the screen?"
  â†“
LLM Agent: Recognizes need for visual context
  â†“
Agent calls: capture_screenshot() tool
  â†“
Vision Pipeline: Captures frame on demand
  â†“
Agent calls: analyze_screenshot() tool
  â†“
Agent responds: With visual analysis and commentary
```

### 2. **Tool Integration**
- LangChain tools provide structured access to vision capabilities
- Agent can chain multiple tools together
- Results fed back to LLM for natural responses

### 3. **Fallback Mechanisms**
- Vision pipeline on-demand capture (primary)
- NDI service direct access (secondary)
- PIL screen capture (tertiary)

## Testing

Created `test_agentic_vision.py` to verify:
- âœ… Vision pipeline on-demand capture
- âœ… Vision integration service screenshot capture
- âœ… LangChain tools functionality
- âœ… Agentic behavior with test messages

## Usage Examples

### Discord Commands
```
User: "What's happening in the game right now?"
Danzar: [Uses screenshot tools automatically] "I can see you're in the middle of a battle..."

User: "Can you see my health bar?"
Danzar: [Captures screenshot] "Your health is at about 75% and you have 3 potions left..."
```

### Natural Conversation
```
User: "What do you think about this UI layout?"
Danzar: [Takes screenshot] "The interface is quite clean, but that minimap placement..."
```

## Configuration

The system respects existing configuration in:
- `config/vision_config.yaml` - Vision pipeline settings
- `config/global_settings.yaml` - Service endpoints
- Game-specific profiles in `config/profiles/`

## Future Enhancements

1. **Smart Screenshot Timing**: LLM could learn when screenshots are most valuable
2. **Contextual Analysis**: Screenshots could be analyzed based on conversation context
3. **Memory Integration**: Visual context could be stored in RAG memory
4. **Multi-Modal Responses**: Combine visual analysis with audio commentary

## Conclusion

The agentic vision system successfully transforms DanzarAI from a reactive system that continuously scans for events to an intelligent agent that captures visual context only when needed. This provides better performance, more natural conversation flow, and gives users explicit control over when vision capabilities are used.

The implementation leverages LangChain's tool system to provide the LLM with structured access to vision capabilities while maintaining the system's personality and conversational style.
