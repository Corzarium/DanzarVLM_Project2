# Screenshot Integration for VLM Summary

## 🎯 **Feature Overview**

The vision integration system now includes **full screenshot capture** that sends the current screen image to the VLM (Vision Language Model) when vision events trigger. This gives the VLM complete visual context about what YOLO, OCR, and CLIP are detecting.

## ✅ **What Was Added**

### 1. **Dedicated Screenshot Capture Method**
Added `_capture_current_screenshot()` method that:
- **Captures fresh screenshots** when events trigger (not stale frames)
- **Uses multiple fallback methods** for reliability
- **Optimizes image size and quality** for VLM processing

### 2. **Multiple Screenshot Sources**
The system tries these methods in order:

1. **NDI Service** (most reliable for game capture)
   - Uses the NDI service's last captured frame
   - Best for game-specific content

2. **Vision Pipeline** (if available)
   - Uses vision pipeline's current frame
   - Good for processed game content

3. **PIL Screen Capture** (fallback)
   - Direct screen capture using PIL
   - Works for any application

### 3. **Image Processing for VLM**
Added `_process_frame_for_vlm()` method that:
- **Resizes images** to optimal size (640x480) for VLM
- **Converts to JPEG** with high quality (85%) for better analysis
- **Encodes to base64** for inclusion in prompts

### 4. **Enhanced Prompt Creation**
Updated `_create_unified_prompt()` to:
- **Capture fresh screenshots** when events trigger
- **Include full visual context** in VLM prompts
- **Provide complete game state** to the VLM

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### Screenshot Capture Flow:
```
Vision Event Detected
    ↓
Capture Fresh Screenshot
    ↓
Process for VLM (resize, encode)
    ↓
Include in Unified Prompt
    ↓
Send to VLM with Full Context
```

### Image Processing Details:
- **Target Size**: 640x480 pixels (optimal for VLM)
- **Format**: JPEG with 85% quality
- **Encoding**: Base64 for prompt inclusion
- **Fallback**: Multiple capture methods

## 🎮 **Benefits for Gaming Commentary**

### 1. **Complete Visual Context**
The VLM now sees:
- **Full game screen** (not just detected objects)
- **UI elements** and game interface
- **Visual relationships** between objects
- **Game state** and environment

### 2. **Better Commentary Quality**
- **More accurate analysis** of game situations
- **Context-aware responses** about what's happening
- **Visual relationship understanding** between detected elements
- **Game state awareness** for better commentary

### 3. **Enhanced VLM Understanding**
- **Spatial relationships** between detected objects
- **Visual context** for OCR text
- **Game environment** and setting
- **UI state** and player interface

## 📊 **Test Results**

The screenshot integration test confirmed:

✅ **Screenshot Capture**: 1600x900 → 640x360 (96,880 chars)  
✅ **JPEG Encoding**: Valid base64 format  
✅ **Frame Processing**: Successful test frame processing  
✅ **Prompt Integration**: Screenshots included in VLM prompts  

### Log Output:
```
[VisionIntegration] 📸 Using PIL screen capture
[VisionIntegration] 📸 Original frame size: 1600x900
[VisionIntegration] 📸 Resized to: 640x360
[VisionIntegration] 📸 JPEG encoded: 96880 chars
[VisionIntegration] ✅ Screenshot captured successfully: 96880 chars
```

## 🚀 **How It Works in Practice**

### When a Vision Event Triggers:
1. **YOLO detects** a person in the game
2. **OCR reads** text from the screen
3. **Fresh screenshot** is captured immediately
4. **Unified prompt** is created with:
   - YOLO detections
   - OCR text
   - Full screenshot
   - Game context
5. **VLM receives** complete visual context
6. **Commentary generated** with full understanding

### Example VLM Prompt:
```
<|im_start|>system
You are DanzarAI, an intelligent gaming assistant with advanced vision capabilities...

Current Game: EverQuest
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
I'm watching a game and detected some interesting elements. Here's what I found:

**YOLO Object Detections:**
person (90%), computer (80%)

**OCR Text Detected:**
"Health: 85%", "Mana: 60%", "Level 15"

**Trigger Event:**
ocr: Health: 85% (confidence: 95%)

**Visual Analysis:**
<image>
/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wBDAAUDBAQEAwUEBAQFBQ...
</image>

As a gaming commentator with vision capabilities, provide a brief, engaging response about what you see.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
```

## 📋 **Configuration**

### Screenshot Settings:
```yaml
# In vision_integration_service.py
target_width, target_height = 640, 480  # Optimal VLM size
encode_params = [cv2.IMWRITE_JPEG_QUALITY, 85]  # High quality
```

### Performance Considerations:
- **Image size**: Optimized for VLM processing
- **Quality**: Balanced between detail and performance
- **Capture frequency**: Only when events trigger
- **Fallback methods**: Multiple capture sources

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### If Screenshots Don't Work:
1. **Check NDI service**: `!status` command
2. **Verify PIL installation**: `pip install Pillow`
3. **Check permissions**: Screen capture permissions
4. **Review logs**: Look for screenshot capture messages

### Log Messages to Look For:
```
[VisionIntegration] 📸 Capturing fresh screenshot for VLM...
[VisionIntegration] 📸 Using PIL screen capture
[VisionIntegration] ✅ Screenshot captured successfully: XXXXX chars
```

## 📝 **Summary**

The screenshot integration feature provides the VLM with **complete visual context** when vision events trigger, enabling:

- **Better commentary quality** with full visual understanding
- **More accurate analysis** of game situations
- **Enhanced context awareness** for the VLM
- **Improved gaming commentary** experience

This creates a **comprehensive vision system** that combines object detection, text recognition, and full visual context for intelligent gaming commentary! 🎮👁️📸
